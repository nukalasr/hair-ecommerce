# Gemini Code Review

This document provides a summary of the `hair-ecommerce` project, generated by Google's Gemini model.

## Project Overview

This project is a client-side prototype of an e-commerce application for hair products, built with Angular 17. It simulates a backend using mock data and features a strong, security-conscious architecture for a prototype. This includes robust client-side password hashing (PBKDF2) and data encryption (AES-GCM) for storing sensitive information.

The code is well-structured with a clear separation of concerns, which will facilitate a future transition to a real backend API.

## Key Features

*   **Role-Based Authentication:** Supports "buyer" and "seller" user roles.
*   **Product Management:** Sellers can list and manage products.
*   **Product Browsing:** Buyers can browse and search for products.
*   **Shopping Cart:** Buyers can add products to a shopping cart.
*   **Checkout:** A checkout process is implemented.
*   **Seller Dashboard:** A dedicated dashboard for sellers.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

3.  **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will build the project for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

4.  **Run Tests:**
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
    This will launch the Karma test runner and execute the unit tests.
